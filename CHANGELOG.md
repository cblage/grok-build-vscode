# Changelog

## 2.0.11-sandbox.5 - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Strict-derived profiles now permit path traversal without widening readable content.** The generated Seatbelt policy grants metadata access to the exact ancestor directories of each configured read root (such as `/`, `/Users`, and `/opt`) while keeping their siblings and descendants blocked. This lets the standalone broker runtime resolve its executable and working directory instead of aborting before its protocol starts.

---

## 2.0.11-sandbox.4 - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Strict-derived profiles now start the delegated-operation broker with a standalone Node runtime when available.** This keeps the sandboxed child free of Electron's Chromium and Crashpad bootstrap reads, which could abort the broker under `strict` before its protocol became ready. The extension logs the selected runtime and admits only that runtime's installation roots to the strict read boundary.

---

## 2.0.11-sandbox.3 - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Custom `read_only` paths now match Grok's additive profile semantics.** They grant reads without revoking writes inherited from `strict`, `workspace`, `devbox`, or `read-only`; the base profile and `read_write` entries continue to govern writable roots. This removes the extra broker policy rule that could abort a strict-derived custom profile during startup.

---

## 2.0.11-sandbox.2 - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Strict-derived custom profiles now preserve writable descendants of a broader `read_only` path.** A profile can make `$HOME` read-only while retaining inherited project and `$GROK_HOME` writes plus explicit writable paths such as caches. This prevents the Seatbelt broker from exiting before startup when those paths overlap.

---

## 2.0.11-sandbox.1 - 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Native macOS sandboxing for Grok sessions, carried forward onto upstream v2.0.10.** The extension applies Grok-compatible Seatbelt protection to the complete session: the selected profile is passed to Grok's own process-lifetime sandbox and mirrored for delegated ACP filesystem operations, terminal commands, and their descendants.
  - **Built-in profiles:** `workspace` can write the project, all of `$GROK_HOME`, and trusted temporary storage; `devbox` can write existing top-level trees except `/data` and virtual filesystems; `read-only` can write only `$GROK_HOME` and temporary storage; and `strict` additionally limits reads to the project and essential runtime paths. As in Grok itself, child-network restriction is a no-op on macOS.
  - **Grok-spec profile loading:** built-in and custom profiles are discovered and resolved according to Grok's own sandbox specification. Custom definitions load from `$GROK_HOME/sandbox.toml` or project `.grok/sandbox.toml`, derive directly from `workspace`, `devbox`, `read-only`, or `strict`, and support additional read-only paths, writable paths, network intent, and kernel-enforced exact or glob denies. Project definitions replace same-name user definitions, built-in names remain reserved, profile names are case-sensitive, and only exact lowercase `off` disables sandboxing.
  - **Session behavior:** the chosen profile is fixed for the life of a conversation and restored when that conversation resumes. Built-in application failures warn and continue like Grok; invalid or unapplied custom profiles refuse to start; and loss of the live delegated-operation sandbox ends the affected session instead of silently weakening it.
  - **Sandbox controls:** supported macOS hosts get a compact lock/unlock indicator stacked between the voice and Send controls; profile names, distinct source icons, and source labels for built-in, user-defined, and workspace-defined profiles live in its picker. The sandbox control stays disabled from session startup through the full active turn because its boundary is fixed for the conversation, while Agent Mode remains available mid-turn; changing the profile of an existing conversation opens the Summarize or Just Restart flow required to start a new session under the new boundary.
  - See the [macOS sandbox architecture guide](docs/macos-sandbox-architecture.md) for the full access matrix, profile resolution rules, process topology, and enforcement boundary.

## 2.0.10 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Read completed replies aloud.** A new toggle (gear → Config & debug) speaks each finished reply via speech synthesis, skipping code blocks — separate on/off state for VS Code and for AFK Pilot.

### Fixed

- **AFK Pilot's text size no longer follows VS Code's own chat zoom.** The two are meant to be fully independent; changing the desktop zoom while a device was linked could silently affect AFK Pilot's own scale too.
- **Picking a different repository from AFK Pilot could get stuck showing the old one.** A live, not-yet-saved-to-disk session from whichever repository you'd been in could leak into the newly selected repository's history and be mistaken for "already open," so the screen sometimes never switched over.

---

## 2.0.9 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Attach documents from AFK Pilot.** The remote **+** picker gains *Add document* next to *Add photo* — `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.docx` (up to 20 MiB) attach as an explicit path chip, exactly like a local drag-and-drop, so Grok reads the file with its own tools. Linked devices on an older release simply don't see the option.

### Fixed

- **Security: a linked remote device could reference files outside your workspace via an `@`-mention.** Selecting a mention result resolved the picked path by joining it to the workspace root with no containment check, so a crafted path from a remote client could point outside the workspace and have its contents attached to the next message. Remote mentions are now resolved exclusively against the host's own indexed file catalog — the same list the autocomplete popup offered — never against an arbitrary path. Present since `@`-mention shipped (v1.7.5); if you use Remote Control (AFK Pilot), update when convenient.
---

## 2.0.8 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Long command output and diffs no longer scroll inside a small box** ([#71](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/71)). A command's captured output and an edit's inline diff now show a short preview that grows **inline** — *View all* / *Show more* — so the page scrolls normally instead of trapping you in a nested scrollbar. On a linked device, where there's no editor to open the full text, both expand in place.
- **Permission-card keyboard polish** ([#68](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/68)): the option with keyboard focus now shows a clear outline, and answering a card returns focus to the composer.

---

## 2.0.7 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Switching repository from your phone no longer changes what VS Code shows.** The choice is shared across your remote devices on purpose — that's the point of it — but VS Code has no repository picker, so it now stays on the workspace you have open: its history list keeps showing that project's sessions, and *New session* starts there. Previously a phone switching projects silently re-scoped the list and pointed *New session* at a different checkout.

---

## 2.0.6 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **Worktree sessions are back in their repository's history** ([2.0.5](#205--2026-07-26) regression). They were matched to their parent by comparing the repository's *git root* against the folder open in VS Code — the same path in the usual case, but not when you open a *subdirectory* of a repository, and then those sessions vanished from the list. The parent repository now lists every worktree session again, as it did before 2.0.5.
- **A worktree opened directly as your workspace is now a repository in its own right.** It was excluded from the picker as "not a repository you choose between", which left *Clear all history* pointing at an entry that wasn't in the list — so it silently did nothing after you confirmed it.

---

## 2.0.5 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Switch repositories from a linked AFK Pilot device.** The chat header on the web client gains a repo chip listing every project Grok has sessions for — pick one to browse its history, pin the ones you reach for, then *New session* to start Grok there. A project's worktrees come with it instead of appearing as separate entries. The chip is remote-only: in VS Code the window already *is* the repository.

### Fixed

- **Re-linking a machine no longer costs you a device slot.** Linking was tracked per link rather than per machine, so re-pairing after a reinstall or a failed connection added a *second* device and could push you past your device limit — for hardware you already had. A re-link now supersedes that machine's previous entry.

---

## 2.0.4 — 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- **The native diff editor shows the whole file**, opened on the first changed line, instead of a context-free preview of only the replaced lines ([#66](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/66)). Grok never sends the file itself, so both sides are reconstructed from the copy on disk plus its per-site line metadata — anchored per site, so a repeated token can't become a phantom change. An unreadable, oversized, or since-modified file falls back to the previous region-only diff. Thanks to [@padixa](https://github.com/padixa) for the report and the follow-up that scoped it.

---

## 2.0.3 — 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Edit a sent message** — hover your latest message → *Edit*. It removes that turn (restoring any files it changed) and puts the text back in the composer so you can fix it and send again. The exact complement of Rewind, which is offered on every earlier message. ([#56](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/56))
- **Rewind now returns the message's text to the composer** too — it always deleted that message, so it no longer discards what you wrote.
- **Keyboard on permission cards** ([#68](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/68)): *Allow once* is ordered first and takes focus when the composer is idle, so Enter approves. Arrows move between options, Escape returns to the composer without answering, and typing any character jumps to the composer instead of pressing a button. A keystroke never selects *Allow always*.

### Fixed

- **Turning off the active-file context chip is now remembered** ([#67](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/67)). The chip is rebuilt whenever you switch files, which silently re-enabled it — so dismissing it was futile. The eye-off choice now persists across file switches and restarts.
- **Rewind discarded one turn too many.** Grok's rewind removes the message it targets, not just what follows; the confirmation said the opposite. Both the wording and the targeting are corrected, so Rewind and Edit now remove exactly the turns they name.
- **Rewind left stale plan and permission cards behind.** Those cards are stored by the extension, not by Grok, so rewinding the conversation stranded the ones belonging to deleted turns — they reappeared at the bottom of the restored chat. Both actions now drop them.
- **Plan snapshot files no longer pile up.** Reopening a session re-wrote a fresh copy of every saved plan, so one session accumulated 13 identical files. Snapshots are now named by their content and reused, and a session's snapshots are deleted with the session.
- **Rewinding now refunds the discarded turns' tokens.** The session billing total counted turns that no longer exist. Usage is recorded per turn, so the total is recomputed from what survives. (Sessions from before this change keep their existing total — there's nothing stored to subtract.)
- **Rewind and Edit no longer reload the conversation.** They deleted the whole chat, showed the welcome screen and re-rendered every message; now only the removed turns disappear.
- **Confirmations for Rewind/Edit are now in-chat**, like every other destructive confirm — no native VS Code modal.
- **No confirmation dialog unless code will be reverted.** A conversation-only rewind or edit just happens — the message goes straight back to the composer. Turns that changed files on disk still ask, since that part cannot be undone.
- **Steered messages no longer break Rewind and Edit.** A message sent mid-turn isn't a separate prompt and has no restore point; counting it shifted every later message by one, so Rewind targeted the wrong turn (reverting the wrong files) and Edit failed. Steered messages are now excluded and offer neither action.

### Changed

- Gear → Remote Control: *Your AFK Pilot account* → *Your account*.

---

## 2.0.2 — 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- **Files missing from the composer's `@` autocomplete** in large workspaces ([#69](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/issues/69)). The file index was capped at 5000 entries, and past that cap VS Code returns an arbitrary subset — so real source files could be absent while less relevant ones still showed. Any file open as a tab is now always mentionable, and the new `grok.mentionIndexLimit` setting raises the cap for big repos. Thanks to [@datvm](https://github.com/datvm) for the diagnosis and the fix ([#70](https://github.com/phuryn/grok-build-vscode/pull/70)).

---

## 2.0.1 — 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Keep this machine awake while an [AFK Pilot](https://afkpilot.com) device is linked**, so a turn you started from your phone isn't cut off by idle sleep — `caffeinate` on macOS, `SetThreadExecutionState` on Windows, `systemd-inhibit` on Linux. Only system sleep is blocked (the display still sleeps), the lock is released the moment you sign out, and it never survives closing VS Code. Turn it off with `grok.remote.keepAwake`. A closed laptop lid still suspends on every OS.

---

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-25

The extension pairs with **[AFK Pilot](https://afkpilot.com)** — a companion web client that brings your Grok sessions to your phone or any browser — and moves to a Fair Source license.

### Added

- **Remote control via [AFK Pilot](https://afkpilot.com)** — gear → *Remote Control* → **Sign in (link this device)** pairs this machine with the AFK Pilot web client: follow running turns, approve permissions, answer questions, and send or steer messages from a phone or any browser while away from your desk. The extension dials out to the service (no inbound port); **Sign out** unlinks the device here and revokes it on your account. The experimental `grok.remoteControl.relayUrl` setting is gone — pairing is one click now.
- **Touch-ready chat UI** — real tap targets on touch screens, always-visible actions on history rows / images / equations / diagrams (previously hover-only), roomier question and permission cards, and in-browser PNG download for generated images, math, and Mermaid diagrams. A resize (e.g. the mobile keyboard collapsing) no longer yanks the chat to the bottom.
- ` ```math ` / ` ```latex ` / ` ```tex ` code fences render as display equations, like ` ```mermaid ` already did for diagrams.

### Changed

- **License: MIT → FSL-1.1-MIT (Fair Source).** Free to use, modify, and redistribute for any purpose except a competing commercial product or service; each release automatically becomes plain **MIT two years after publication**. Versions up to and including 1.8.1 were published under MIT and remain MIT. ([LICENSE](LICENSE))
- **Destructive confirmations are now in-chat dialogs** (delete session, clear all history, apply/remove worktree, remote sign-out) instead of native VS Code modals, so they behave identically in the sidebar and the AFK Pilot browser client.
- Card titles render in the UI font instead of the editor's monospace.
