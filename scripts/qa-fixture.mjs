// The grok-qa fixture: a project tree AND a session store, both deterministic.
//
// Every end-to-end check we had fabricated its own throwaway workspace, which
// meant two things. Screenshots were not comparable run to run — the frames
// literally said `grok-screens-ws-7TWbru` in the project row — and no check
// ever saw a rail with more than one conversation in it, so anything that only
// goes wrong with accumulated history (ordering, paging, pins, archives) was
// invisible to all of them.
//
// This builds the same store every time: fixed ids, fixed timestamps, fixed
// bytes. `GROK_HOME` is a supported override (`resolveGrokHome`), so pointing a
// host at one of these needs no product change.
//
// Deliberately NOT a committed directory: a session store is mtimes as much as
// it is files, and git does not carry mtimes. Generating it is what makes the
// ordering reproducible.
