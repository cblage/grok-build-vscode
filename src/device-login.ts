/**
 * Device-code sign-in — the pure half.
 *
 * `runGrokLogin` has always opened an interactive terminal on the desk. That is
 * the right thing on a desk (the CLI opens the browser for you) and it is why
 * the capability was `host-local`: a phone can neither see that terminal nor
 * type into it, and opening one on someone's machine from elsewhere is not
 * something a remote should be able to do.
 *
 * The CLIs have since grown headless flows that print a URL and a short code
 * and then poll. That is the whole flow a phone needs — display two strings,
 * wait. So the remote path runs the CLI with pipes and renders what it printed
 * into the transcript, and the desk path is untouched.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, 2026-08-26, because two of the three surprised us:
 *
 *   grok 1.0.5    `grok login --device-auth`   works on pipes. Prints the URL
 *                 and the code to STDERR (not stdout), keeps polling, exits 0
 *                 when the browser approves.
 *   claude 2.1.246 `claude setup-token`        prints NOTHING to a pipe. It is
 *                 an Ink TUI and wants a real terminal; 18 s of piped stdio
 *                 produced zero bytes on both streams while it happily created
 *                 its config dir. Driving it needs a pty, and a pty means a
 *                 native dependency this repo has deliberately avoided (see
 *                 keep-awake.ts, which picked three OS binaries over one
 *                 native module for exactly this reason).
 *   codex 0.149.0 `codex login --device-auth`  the flag does not exist in this
 *                 build. OpenAI documents it, and it is additionally gated on
 *                 an account setting ("Allow device code login") that a
 *                 workspace admin can withhold.
 *
 * So this module does NOT hardcode "grok works, the others don't". It asks the
 * CLI and believes the answer: {@link deviceLoginPlan} says which command to
 * try, the runner tries it, and {@link classifyDeviceLoginFailure} turns
 * whatever came back into something a person can act on. A codex that grows
 * the flag starts working with no change here, and a claude that stops needing
 * a TTY does too — capability detection, never version numbers.
